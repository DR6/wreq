% wreq: an easy HTTP client for Haskell


# Acknowledgments

I'd like to thank Edward Kmett and Shachaf Ben-Kiki for tirelessly
answering my never-ending stream of
[lens](https://lens.github.io/)-related questions in `#haskell-lens#`.

I also want to thank Michael Snoyman for being so quick with helpful
responses to bug reports and pull requests against his excellent
[http-client](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/http-client) package.
